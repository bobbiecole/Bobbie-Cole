## Interest In IT

I have always been intrigued by IT and advancements in technology, and the limitless possibilities and applications it presents in all aspects of business and in our every-day lives. My interest in IT has grown over the years, as a Marketing professional, I am a creative. Even though visual or content creation is the majority of the work I do, I love developing ideas for technology platforms and applications that can be used to improve efficiencies or increase profits.

I chose to study with RMIT because of its reputation of a practical and hands on approach to learning. I feel like this approach suits me best as I love 'doing while learning' and have ideas for projects that I would love to get started as soon as I can.

I hope that by completign the Bachelor of IT, it will provide me with the knowledge and expertise to develop innovative business and support strategies and applications, and be able to apply these effectively accross business functions.

## Personal Reflection of Results

For me, these results show that I am a strong leader with exceptional skills when it comes to organising, conceiving ideas and starting projects. Unfortunately I may lack the practical skills to keep up with the technical aspects and would fit best in a team with hands-on people who have the ability to push the project along and understand and develop the finer details. 

# Project Idea - Online Franchise Training and Operations Portal

## Overview 

The prospective project is to design and develop an in-depth and interactive online training and operations portal for franchise business owners. It will allow new incoming franchisees to undergo their initial onboarding business training, it will also support current franchise business owners with ongoing training in areas of sales & marketing, human resources and training to be able to create and provide any new products or services developed by the franchisor. The portal will also be their main operations platform that can house; marketing collateral, operations and training manuals, while also having a news and updates feed and have a discussion forum so franchisees can interact and support each other with the day-to-day operations of their business. 

## Motivation

Currently within our franchise network the process of onboarding and training a new franchisee is a very manual process. There are many aspects that could be transferred to an online interactive training portal, especially in the area of business setup and training, as well as sales & marketing and human resources. It would also be ideal to have some form of online testing for each section of training to ensure their competency and compliance of the franchise agreement.

By having training for existing franchisees for any new aspects, this ensures compliance and understanding across the network.
By housing all documentation this puts everything a franchisee needs to succeed at their fingertips- e.g., currently if a franchisee needs a certain document, they have to email the head office as current directories are out of date and difficult for staff to update easily and efficiently.   

## Description

The function of the portal should be to support all key area’s of the business;  training, operations, franchisee support and news and updates which will each be individually outlined below. 

  ### Training
  
When a new franchisee comes on board, there are various areas of training they undergo to launch their new business. Besides their ‘hands-on’ / field training, the below area’s would need to be included in an online interactive training portal. Overall the portal would need to have a function that allows franchisees to know where they are up to with their training by marking sections as complete and saving where they are up to. Upon completion of training, a certificate of completion is produced and sent to both the franchisor and franchisee. It would also need a function where franchisor staff can login to an admin portal and see where a new franchisee is up to with their training.

**Operations Manuals**

The Operations and Training Manuals form part of the Franchise Agreement, it is a franchisees responsibility to ensure they are familiar with its contents and any updates that are made to it, as it contains important obligations in relation to the operation of the business and a breach of the Operations Manual is deemed to be a breach of the Franchise Agreement.
The online training would break the ‘manuals’ down into sections and include reading and video content to be completed with a short quiz at the end of each section to ensure compliance. 

**Sales & Marketing**

Because our business is a B2B business, franchisees need to learn face-to-face sales skills and techniques. This section would include training videos from sales trainers and have downloadable documents that franchisees can use to develop their sales program and give them an ‘action plan’ to use in the day-to-day operation of their business. 

**Human Resources**

Because most franchisees have never ran their own business before, there is a need for them to understand processes and requirements of advertising for staff, the hiring process and legal documentation for new employees. Because it is a franchise network, each employee of a franchisee has to be approved by the franchisor and hold copies of all documentation. This training would take them through the all steps and have downloadable documents to help them along the way.

**Systems & Processes**

Our business is a service-based business (real estate photography, floor plans, property videos), with the finished product being delivered through our online cloud-based platform to clients. 
Franchisees need to undergo training of how to use the platform for uploading, invoicing and reporting. This section of the training would need to be hands-on i.e., having interactive activities where they do dummy uploads, produce invoices, and know how to use the system.

**Operations**

The operations aspect of the portal is where a franchisee would be able to access everything they need for the day-to-day operations of their business. It would house copies of operations manuals, marketing collateral including; brochures, business card templates and other visual collateral for printing, example social media posts etc., 
The portal would also need an upload requirement where franchisees can send through all required documentation for a new employee to have them approved by the franchisor. 

**Franchise Support**

This section of the portal would be a forum where franchisees can post topics, questions and ideas and have interaction within the network to support each other in their businesses. 

  ### Tools & Technologies
  
The platform would require a web server and online hosting for the portal with enough memory space to hold documentation, files and videos. There would be a variety of open source tools required for the many functions needed within the platform for example, a communication tool for the implementation of the forum and news feeds. 

It would need to be designed for multi-device support, enabling users to access the portal across devices including; laptops, tablets and smartphones.

### Skills Required

The skills required for this project would be software coding, specifically in the area of online development. Because we are a small organization with a limited budget, For this particular project, it may be more feasible to purchase an off-the-shelf package, that can be customised to incorporate all of the above requirements. Though the skill of an IT professional would be required to implement the necessary changes.

Because it needs to be easily accessible and usable by all franchisor staff to update training and sections easily (i.e., the production team also needs to be able to easily upload a new training video), the portal also needs to have an administration/backend portal for contributors, as it would not be efficient if they had to request changes/updates via a third party.

### Outcome

If the project is successful it will have a positive impact on all areas of the business for both the franchisor and franchisees. 

It will modernise the new franchise training process and eliminate current manual processes that cost time, money and resources. Currently franchisees visit the head office for ‘classroom’ style training with several team members of the head-office staff over several days. If this is implemented, they could complete their training from anywhere and their visit to the head-office can be focussed solely on the practical skills/field training, and getting to know the staff and support personnel and to clarify any questions or concerns they have after completing the training.

By having the operations function, this will save precious time as franchisees will have everything they need at their fingertips, as opposed to having to contact specific franchisor staff for different aspects of the business (i.e., currently contact Marketing personnel for marketing collateral, operations for manuals and guides, production for technical information)

The franchise support, news and updates will hopefully aid in building the company culture and interaction between the franchisor, its staff and the franchisees.

I believe the development of this portal will improve compliance across the franchise network, increase efficiencies for both the franchisor and franchisees, allowing both the head office team and franchisees to focus on business building and profit producing  activities.
